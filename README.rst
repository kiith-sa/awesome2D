Advanced lighting in 2D graphics
================================ 

This repository will store all information and source code
related to my Bachelor thesis. The goals of this project are:

* Create an advanced shader-based 3D to sprite converter
  capable of pre-rendering arbitrary data (such as surface 3D
  coordinates, normals, specularity and so on),

* Design a lighting model using sprites pre-rendered by
  the converter to achieve high-quality ("3D") lighting in 2D.

* Create a demo application utilizing this lighting model.

* Optional: Create multiple lighting models (and demo applications)
  using various sets of pre-rendered data and compare them.
