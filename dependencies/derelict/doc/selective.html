<h2>Selective Symbol Loading</h2>
There may be times when you want to provide backwards compatibility with an
older version of a library, or when you know that a particular build of a library
you are using is missing some functions that a Derelict package loads. Derelict,
by default, throws a <tt>SymbolLoadException</tt> when a shared library symbol
cannot be found. In order to allow the client to bypass this default behavior,
the <a href="util.html">DerelictUtil</a> package provides a callback mechanism
that allows you to selectively throw exceptions when symbols are missing.

<h3>MissingSymbolCallback</h3>
The <tt>derelict.util.exception</tt> module defines a type <tt>MissingSymbolCallback</tt>.
The type definition looks like this:

<pre>
alias bool function(string libName, string symbolName) MissingSymbolCallback;
</pre>

<p>
When a symbol fails to load, Derelict first checks if a <tt>MissingSymbolCallback</tt>
has been set. If not, a <tt>SymbolLoadException</tt> is thrown. But, if a callback
has been set, then the callback is called with the name of the library
and the name of the missing symbol as arguments. The callback should return <tt>true</tt> if
loading should continue and <tt>false</tt> if a <tt>SymbolLoadException</tt> should be thrown.
Callbacks can be set using the function <tt>Derelict_SetMissingSymbolCallback</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Following is a complete example of using this feature. Older versions of SDL
did not include functions to test for CPU capabilities.
<a href="sdl.html">DerelictSDL</a> always attempts to load those functions since
they are present in the latest versions. It is possible to load older versions
of the SDL shared library by ignoring the CPU related functions. This example
demonstrates how to do that.
</p>

<pre>
import derelict.util.exception;             // MissingSymbolCallback interface declared here
import derelict.sdl.sdl;

import std.string;

bool SDLMissingSymbolCallback(char[] libName, char[] procName)
{
    // there are 8 functions in SDL's CPU interface - test for them all.
    // If the procName matches any one of them, return true to ignore the missing
    // function.
    if( procName.cmp("SDL_HasRDTSC") == 0 ||
        procName.cmp("SDL_HasMMX") == 0 ||
        procName.cmp("SDL_HasMMXExt") == 0 ||
        procName.cmp("SDL_Has3DNow") == 0 ||
        procName.cmp("SDL_Has3DNowExt") == 0 ||
        procName.cmp("SDL_HasSSE") == 0 ||
        procName.cmp("SDL_HasSSE2") == 0 ||
        procName.cmp("SDL_HasAltiVec") == 0)
            return true;        // ignore the error and throw no exception

    // a function other than one of those above failed to load - return false
    // to indicate that an exception should be thrown.
    return false;
}

void main()
{
   // the callback must be set before loading the library(ies) you want the callback to handle
   Derelict_SetMissingProcCallback(&myMissingProcCallback);
   DerelictSDL.load();
}
</pre>

<p>
It is important to note that the callback must be set before loading the library
you are interested in filtering. You can implement one callback for multiple libraries if you like,
and filter them based upon the <tt>libName</tt> parameter. Or you can define multiple callbacks to
handle one library each - as long as you call <tt>Derelict_SetMissingSymbolCallback</tt> with the
appropriate callback argument before loading each library.

<span class="important">This is an optional feature and is not required to use
Derelict</span>. It is provided to give an even greater degree of flexibility
and control to those who need it.
