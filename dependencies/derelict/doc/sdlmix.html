<h2>DerelictSDLMixer</h2>
DerelictSDLMixer is a D binding to Sam Lantinga's
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">SDL_mixer</a>, a cross-platform,
multichannel, audio mixer library designed to be used together with
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>.

<p>
The current version of DerelictSDLMixer requires <tt>SDL_mixer 1.2.11</tt> or later.
</p>


<h3>Building</h3>
To compile DerelictSDLMixer, add the <tt>DerelictSDLMixer</tt> make target to the command line when
compiling Derelict. For example, to build DerelictSDLMixer on Windows with DMD, you would execute the following:
<pre><code>
make -fwin32.mak DerelictSDLMixer DC=DMD
</code></pre>
For more information on compiling Derelict libraries, see <a href="build.html">Building the
Derelict Bindings</a>.

<h3>Using</h3>
<ol>
<li>Always make sure the DerelictSDLMixer source modules are available on your import
path.</li>
<li>In modules that make use of DerelictSDLMixer, you will need to import the
<tt>derelict.sdl.mixer</tt> and <tt>derelict.sdl.sdl</tt> modules.</li>
<li>You must link your application with the DerelictSDL, DerelictSDLMixer and DerelictUtil libraries.</li>
<li>Before calling any SDL_mixer functions, you need to make a call to <tt>DerelictSDLMixer.load()</tt>.
This will load the shared library.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The following is a complete program that loads DerelictSDLMixer:
</p>

<pre><code>
import derelict.sdl.mixer;

void main()
{
    DerelictSDLMixer.load();

    // now you can call SDL_mixer functions
}
</code></pre>
<p>
As with other Derelict bindings, DerelictSDLMixer will throw an exception if an error
occurs while loading the shared library. For more information on Derelict
exceptions, see the documentation for <a href="use.html#Exceptions">Using the Derelict Bindings</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the method <tt>DerelictSDLMixer.unload()</tt> is provided for convenience. In normal
practice you do not need to call this function, as Derelict will unload the library
automatically when the app exits. You generally should only use this function if
you need to unload DerelictSDLMixer while the application is running or if you disable the
automatic unloading of shared libraries (as per <a href="util.html#Loader">the documentation for the loader module</a>).
