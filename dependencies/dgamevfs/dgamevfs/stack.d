/**
 * A directory seamlessly working on a stack of multiple directories.
 *
 * Directories can be mounted using the $(D mount()) method.
 *
 * When looking for a file or directory in a $(D StackDir), the last directory
 * is searched first, then the second last, and so on. This means that directories
 * mounted later override those mounted before.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * We have a directory called $(I data) with the following contents:
 * --------------------
 * shaders:
 *     font.frag 
 *     font.vert 
 * logs:
 *     (empty)
 * main.cfg
 * --------------------
 * and a directory called $(I user_data) with the following contents:
 * --------------------
 * shaders: 
 *      font.frag
 * logs:
 *      (empty)
 * custom.cfg
 * --------------------
 * the following code will work as specified in the comments:
 * --------------------
 * VFSDir data, user_data; //initialized somewhere before
 * 
 * auto stack = new StackDir("stack");
 * stack.mount(data);
 * stack.mount(user_data);
 *
 * //This will access user_data/shaders/font.frag
 * auto frag = stack.file("shaders/font.frag");
 * //This will access data/shaders/font.vert
 * auto vert = stack.file("shaders/font.vert");
 * //This will return a StackDir (as VFSDir) with "data/logs" and "user_data/logs"
 * //mounted, in that order:
 * auto logs = stack.dir("logs");
 * --------------------
 *
 * Accessing a file in a $(D StackDir) will actually return a $(D StackFile),
 * which decides which file to access on read, write and other operations.
 * The $(D StackFile) is a stack of all files that map to the same path in
 * the $(D StackDir) in the same order as $(D StackDir)'s mounted directories.
 *
 * For example, when reading or determining file size, the directories in the 
 * stack will be searched from newest to oldest and the first file found will 
 * be used.
 *
 * When writing, the file in the newest writable directory will be written to.
 *
 *
 * In some cases, it might be required to access a particular directory in the 
 * stack. E.g. a game might have multiple packages stacked on top of each other,
 * but sometimes default, non-overridden version of a file could be needed.
 * This can be done using the $(B ::) separator. 
 *
 * In the context of the previous example:
 *
 * --------------------
 * //This will access data/shaders/font.frag even though user_data/shaders/font.frag exists
 * auto default_frag = stack.file("data::shaders/font.frag");
 * --------------------
 *
 * $(D StackDir) is considered writable when any directory in the stack is writable.
 * Similarly, it exists when any directory in the stack exists.
 *
 * When we have a $(D StackDir) that does not exist and we $(D create()) it,
 * the newest directory that is writable will be created.
 * (This can happen when getting a nonexistent subdirectory of a $(D StackDir).)
