Gl3n
====

gl3n provides all the math you need to work with OpenGL. Currently gl3n supports:

* linear algebra
  * vectors
  * matrices
  * quaternions
* geometry
  * axis aligned bounding boxes
  * planes
  * frustum (use it with care, not a 100% tested)
* interpolation
  * linear interpolation (lerp)
  * spherical linear interpolation (slerp)
  * hermite interpolation
  * catmull rom interpolation
* colors - hsv to rgb and rgb to hsv conversion
* nearly all GLSL defined functions (according to spec 4.1)
* the power of D, e.g. dynamic swizzling, templated types (vectors, matrices, quaternions), impressive constructors and more!

Documentation
=============

Gl3n uses ddoc for documentation. You can build it easily with the Makefile:

    make ddoc

But there is of course also an [online documentation](http://dav1dde.github.com/gl3n/) available.

Installation
============

On Linux you can build gl3n for yourself with:

    make
    make install

    # archlinux structure:
    make PREFIX=/usr
    make install PREFIX=/usr

Or for debian based systems you can use the .deb packages provided by the
[d-apt repository](http://code.google.com/p/d-apt/wiki/APT_Repository). Gl3n will also
be included in [Fedora 17](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/F17_D2_programming).


On Windows you can also use the Makefile, but you need e.g. [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) to run it.
Otherwise you can use the raw .d files and include them into your project (-I flag).    


Examples
========

```D
vec4 v4 = vec4(1.0f, vec3(2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f));
vec4 v4_2 = vec4(1.0f, vec4(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f).xyz); // "dynamic" swizzling with opDispatch
vec4 v4_3 = v4_2.xxyz; // opDispatch returns a static array which you can pass directly to the ctor of a vector!

vec3 v3 = my_3dvec.rgb;
float[] foo = v4.xyzzzwzyyxw // not useful but possible!

mat4 m4fv = mat4.translation(-0.5f, -0.54f, 0.42f).rotatex(PI).rotatez(PI/2);
glUniformMatrix4fv(location, 1, GL_TRUE, m4fv.value_ptr); // yes they are row major!

mat3 inv_view = view.rotation;
mat3 inv_view = mat3(view);

mat4 m4 = mat4(vec4(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f), 5.0f, 6.0f, 7.0f, 8.0f, vec4(...) ...); 
```

```D
    void strafe_left(float delta) { // A
        vec3 vcross = cross(up, forward).normalized;
        _position = _position + (vcross*delta);
    }

    void strafe_right(float delta) { // D
        vec3 vcross = cross(up, forward).normalized;
        _position = _position - (vcross*delta);
```
